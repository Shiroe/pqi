## Gamma API

- **Ghost events (confirmed 2026-04-03):** Some events exist (fetchable
  by direct ID: `/events/{id}`) but are invisible to ALL list queries — not returned
  by `/events?series_id=...`, `/events?end_date_min=...&end_date_max=...`,
  `/events?tag=...`, or unfiltered `/events`. Their markets are also absent from
  `/markets` list queries. Example: event 273395 (Valorant TH vs NAVI BO3) had
  `active=True, closed=False` with valid markets but was invisible to list endpoints.
  This is a Gamma API indexing bug. No workaround exists on our end — markets in
  ghost events simply won't appear in results. May be related to mid-match settlement
  transitions (de-indexed when some sub-markets start resolving).
- **Order params (confirmed 2026-04):** Only `order=volume` and
  `order=liquidity` work. `order=end_date` and `order=volume_24hr` return 422.
- **Events vs markets endpoint:** `/events` for time-window and category queries
  (groups related markets, has tags); `/markets` for unfiltered general queries.
  `/markets` has `tag_id` param but NOT `series_id`. `/events` has both `tag_id`
  and `tag_slug` (direct slug filtering, no ID resolution needed). Both endpoints
  have server-side volume filtering (`volume_min` on events, `volume_num_min` on markets).
  Embedded markets in events lack nested `events` key — category from parent event's
  `tags` via `_category_from_event()`.
- **Event live/ended fields:** Events have `live`, `ended`, `gameStatus`, `score`,
  `elapsed`, `period` fields (from OpenAPI spec). These are populated on
  `/public-search` and direct `/events/{id}` but always `None` on `/events` list
  endpoint. Code checks `ended=True` when available but cannot rely on it from lists.
- **Market acceptingOrders:** Set to `False` on some decided markets but inconsistent.
  Markets can show `YES=0.00, acceptingOrders=True` when parent event is `ended=True`.
  Code filters out `acceptingOrders=False` as a first-pass filter.
- **event_start_time query params:** NOT supported on any endpoint. Silently ignored
  (returns 200 but doesn't filter). All event start time filtering is client-side.
- **Two-tier category resolution:** Specific series slugs (e.g. "counter-strike")
  use server-side `series_id` filter on `/events`. Broad tags (e.g. "esports") use
  server-side `tag_id` filter on `/events`. Tag resolution uses `/tags/slug/<slug>`
  for fast exact lookup, falling back to paginated `/tags` for partial matches.
- Field notes: `outcomePrices` is JSON string `'["0.73", "0.27"]'`;
  `volumeNum` is float USD; must pass `closed=false` + `active=true`.

## CLOB API

- **Response format:** `{"history": [{t, p}]}` (dict with `history` key, not a
  bare list). `t` is unix timestamp (int), `p` is float (not string).
- Very short-lived markets (5-min crypto windows) may return only 1 data point —
  handled by the <2 guard.
- `clobTokenIds` on the Gamma API is a JSON string (needs `json.loads()`),
  index 0 = YES token, index 1 = NO token.
- YES + NO CLOB prices don't sum to 1.0 (spread/vig) — both sides fetched independently.
- **Price history is informational only:** The weighted average and trend data
  enrich the briefing for agents. Scoring gates (ROI, price floor/ceiling) still
  use the real `yes_price` snapshot since that's the actual tradeable price.

## Scoring & Council

- **Volume floor behavior:** General queries use `MIN_VOLUME_USD` ($10K default).
  Short time windows (≤ `SHORT_WINDOW_HOURS`, default 4h) use
  `MIN_VOLUME_SHORT_WINDOW_USD` ($500 default). `--min-volume 0` disables all filtering.
- **Min-tradeable-price gate:** Recommended side must cost >= MIN_TRADEABLE_PRICE
  (default 5c). Prevents "BUY NO at $0.01" on near-over events.
- **Council quorum gate:** At least `MIN_COUNCIL_VERDICTS` (default 5) of 7 agents
  must return valid verdicts. Below this the analysis aborts. Agents retry up to
  `AGENT_MAX_RETRIES` times with exponential backoff (cap 30s) before being dropped.
- **Two-sided confidence:** Agents output separate confidence_yes and confidence_no.
  Parser falls back to legacy confidence_level (both sides equal) if agent doesn't
  produce the new fields. Scoring evaluates BUY YES from yes_edge + yes-side
  confidence, BUY NO from no_edge + no-side confidence independently.
- **LOCAL_LLM_CONCURRENCY:** Only applies to Ollama backend. Anthropic calls skip
  the semaphore entirely. Default 1 for consumer GPUs.
- Council JSON parser: Pass 1 direct json.loads(), Pass 2 strip control chars.

## Environment

- `.env` uses `CLAUDE_API_KEY` instead of `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. `config.py` accepts
  either (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` checked first, `CLAUDE_API_KEY` as fallback).
- `TAVILY_API_KEY` is validated as required at import time.
- LLM_BACKEND: `anthropic` (tested, working with claude-haiku-4-5-20251001)
- Ollama: installed, llama3.1:8b available as fallback
- LOCAL_LLM_CONCURRENCY: 1 (only affects Ollama; Anthropic runs fully parallel)
